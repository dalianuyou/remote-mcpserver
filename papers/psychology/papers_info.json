    "summary": "Understanding mind-brain-environment relations is one of the key topics in psychology. Kurt Lewin, inspired by theoretical physics, tried to establish topological and vector psychology analyzing patterns of interaction between the individual and her/his environment. The time is ripe to reformulate his ambitious goals, searching for ways to interpret objectively measured brain processes in terms of suitable psychological constructs. Connecting cognitive and social psychology constructs to neurophenomics, as it is done now in psychiatry, should ground them in physical reality.",

    "summary": "There are numerous opportunities for engaging in research at the intersection of psychology and visualization. While most opportunities taken up by the VIS community will likely focus on the psychology of users, there are also opportunities for studying the psychology of designers. In this position paper, I argue the importance of studying design cognition as a necessary component of a holistic program of research on visualization psychology. I provide a brief overview of research on design cognition in other disciplines, and discuss opportunities for VIS to build an analogous research program. Doing so can lead to a stronger integration of research and design practice, can provide a better understanding of how to educate and train future designers, and will likely surface both challenges and opportunities for future research.",
